This lab creates a motor class object called MotorDriver that runs a quick test program to control the DC motor for five seconds. The class contains
an initializer for appropriate pin and channel objects as well as a method to control the duty cycle which can be given as an input. The duty cycle is 
used in PWM as a percentage by the integer variable "level" for the two output pins to control the direction and speed of the motor.
